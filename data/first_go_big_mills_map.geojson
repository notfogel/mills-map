Mr. Brusoe is 67 years old. He used to play the lancers like this for dancing classes in Quebec in the 80's. He was taught to play by his older brother, who was well known as a fiddler in Canada. He says he does not read music but I am not sure this is true, and hope to find out, later. His playing is unusual in that he uses 3rd and 5th positions, and his playing is unusually true, clean and clear, for all his thickened fingers.
